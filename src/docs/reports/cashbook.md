The cash book statement presents a breakdown of transactions in a certain account, example cash, pay-bill, landlord or bank.
The report can be generated as per the cashiers handling the transactions and within some given period.

The transactions are presented together with their details, date, reference number, property and unit plus the amounts with the balances computed at the bottom for carrying to next day.
