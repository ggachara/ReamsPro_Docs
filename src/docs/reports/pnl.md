The profit and loss statement is a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred during a specified period, usually a fiscal quarter or year.

Through this function REAMSPRO can provide a user with the correct company income statement as per the records captured in the system.

This means that entry of records to be reflected in the system should be certain to minimize error rate of statements.
