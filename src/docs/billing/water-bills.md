One of the main stages in the tenancy lifecycle is tenant billing, this involves the identification and generation of due charges to the tenants as per their resource consumption.

In addition to rent, other invoice types you can generate and bill include: water bills, security, garbage, and service charge.

Through this menu you can:

+ **1. Generate Water Bills**
+ **2. Generate Invoices**
+ **3. Raise Credit Notes**

## Generate Water Bills

This tab allows for input of water unit per building/property and outputs the correct amount due from the set building unit rate.

On clicking the New Readings button, the entry tab is brought up.

![New Reading Tab ](../images/readings_list.png)

The capture readings tab, upon selection of building and confirmation of bill date, generates an entry sheet in excel format(1) where the user inputs the new unit readings and uploads them back into the system using the Upload Readings button(2) then finally moves them to the invoicing using the Migrate Readings to Bills(3) button.

A record of all the water unit readings captured is stored in the system as per the building and date of capture and billing and can be retrieved at any moment by a user.
