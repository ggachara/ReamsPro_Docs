The invoice list tab is the bills generation point for all charges due to the tenant.

![Administration ](../images/invoice-list.png)

On the Invoices List tab above controls labelled 1-10 allow:

+ **1. Generation of multiple and varying invoices as per their property and dates.**
+ **2. Generation of invoices due to a single tenant.**
+ **3. Generation of bulk invoices of the same building and type.**
+ **4. Posting of invoices after generation.**
+ **5. Printing of all the invoices that are due to a particular building.**
+ **6. Selection of building that you would like results of filter to be from.**
+ **7. Selection of the status of the invoices to be within results.**
+ **8. Selection of the specific unit results from filter should be from.**
+ **9. The filter button that sorts data available by parameters set by unit.**
+ **10. The number of pages the results of filter occupy.**
+ **11. The search function window for filtering the results further by specific keywords.**

Authorized users can generate the bills either one at a time or in bulk, at any period during the billable month period and of any type all in-line with the company policy.
The invoices generated are dependent on the presets in the tenant details set during tenant registration and have to be posted after generation.

The following are open pop ups of all the above operations,

In periodic you can select all the buildings and invoices at once then click the Generate Invoices button or select one property and invoice type and generate their invoices. The invoices date automatically update with billing periods.

![Single Invoice ](../images/single_tenant_gen.png)

Single tenant invoices are generated from here after capture of the prompted details and input of as many invoices as due to the tenant.
After generation invoices from both controls are listed as unposted in the list tab. 

![Bulk Invoice ](../images/bulk_tenant_inv.png)

Clicking the Get Tenants indicated above after selection of the building and charge type in above tab lists all the tenants of that particular property and their charge amounts for skimming to ensure consistency before generation.

These invoices too are listed in the invoice list tab as unposted and all can be transferred into their respective tenant accounts by clicking on the post all button hence posting them all.

![Print Invoices ](../images/print_bulk_month.png)

If there need for physical invoices, the print bulk control allows it after selection of the specific details. Only generated and posted invoices can be printed.
