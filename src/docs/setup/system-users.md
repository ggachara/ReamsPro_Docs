This tab allows for the creation and management of system users. 

This is an administrative task carried out by the system administrator.

Name, Email, Group, Status, Password are among the details that need to be captured by the admin when registering new users to the system.

The password should be ‘strong’ enough but also easy enough for the user to remember.
