For every payment receipted from the tenants, there are particular invoices that it seeks to clear. 
The invoice categories tab allows for creation of the different invoice types.

The number and type of invoice categories depends on company policy and can be as many and varying as possible and are added by clicking on the Add New Category as shown below:
