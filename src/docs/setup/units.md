After the registration of landlords and their respective properties, we generate the units to the properties to allow capturing of tenants in the properties.

In this step we generate the units of the particular property as they are physically on site. Units naming can either be numeric, alphabet or even alphanumeric which the system is primed to capture.

There is no limit to the number of units that can be generated to accommodate the tenants in a property.

The Unit List tab also comes with navigation cues namely:

+ **1. Generate New Units**: The generate unit prompt is displayed on clicking.
+ **2. Search Field**: Allows filter of search results with custom key words.
+ **3. Page Count**: Shows the number of pages of the results.
+ **4. Vacant Units**: Shows the list of vacant units across the properties.
+ **5. Occupied Units**: Shows the list of occupied units across the properties.
+ **6. Action button**: Allows the remove/delete option of the unit list.

On clicking the Generate New Units button, a prompt to generate units is displayed.

The prompt shown below upon selection of a building, and a start and end unit number and also a prefix and suffix when needed generates the units requested.

>The prefix and suffix are mostly alphabets.

You can only generate the units per one property to ensure no overlap between different properties.
Unit naming on one property does not affect the naming of units in other properties, so units can have the same names across many properties.
