One of the final tenant operations before vacating the tenant is calculating their final expense to the unit of occupation in regards to repairs.
Clicking the Add New Vacate Record shown above prompts a vacating record dialog into which the details of the vacating tenant are captured.
The final expenses are also filled into the pop-up, they can be as many and different as the tenant has been found to incur. 
The deposit is indicated right above the list of vacate expenses to help in easier calculation of refund or any amounts due from the tenant.
