The tenants  list tab displays the number and details of tenants in the properties under management.
The format of display allows for easy skimming over all tenants and either generally or through specific parameters of interest like property or rent amount

As indicated above the tab has some controls for easier navigation and use to it, which include:

+ **1. Add New Tenant**: On clicking it opens the New Tenant capture tab.
+ **2. Building**: Allows searching list via building.
+ **3. Search**: Customizes search results via keywords.
+ **4. Limit Records**: Varys the breadth of searching terms.
+ **5. Page Count**: Shows the page count of returned results.

On clicking the Add New Tenant button another tab opens as shown below where now all the main details of the tenant are captured into the system.
The tenant codes given to each tenant in the system are auto generated and also unique hence used for reference during storage of records.

Among the details captured during registration of tenants are bill cycle of the tenant, escalation days and rates, penalty days and rates too and some additional notes specific to that tenant.

The next step allows you to specify the unit of occupation with the accompanying charge types and amount, whether the charges are vatable, refundable, recurring while also indicating their bill dates.

The tenant record is safely stored after successful tenant detail data capture and can be retrieved for viewing and/or updating at the userâ€™s convenience.

Perfect tenant record management is one of the key functions of a property manager that **`REAMSPRO`** looks to make easier to perform.
